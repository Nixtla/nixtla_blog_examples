### Working with Marimo Notebooks

#### Creating a New Notebook

Create a new notebook in the `notebooks` directory using marimo:

```bash
uv run marimo edit notebooks/your_notebook_name.py --sandbox
```

#### Publishing Notebooks

To export your marimo notebooks to HTML locally:

1. Make sure the `export_notebook.sh` script is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x export_notebook.sh
   ```

2. Run the script with your notebook name:

   ```bash
   # Either format works:
   ./export_notebook.sh notebooks/notebook_name
   ./export_notebook.sh notebooks/notebook_name.py
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   ./export_notebook.sh notebooks/anomaly_detection
   ./export_notebook.sh notebooks/intermittent_forecasting
   ```

The exported HTML files will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages through the GitHub Actions workflow.
